      ACT I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Interior of an artisan cottage. Door centre, leading direct to street,
      door right to house. Fireplace with kitchen range left. Table centre, with
      print cloth. Two plain chairs under it, one left, one centre, facing
      audience. Rocking-chair by fireplace. Two chairs against wall right, above
      door. Dresser right, below door. Small hanging bookcase on wall, left
      centre. Window right centre. On walls plainly framed photographs of
      Socialist leaders&mdash;Blatchford, Hyndman, Hardie. The time is 7.0 p.m.
      on a June evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>arside is a working-class woman of 50, greyhaired, slight, with red
      toil-worn hands and a face expressive of resignation marred by occasional
      petulance, dressed in a rough serge skirt, dark print blouse,
      elastic-sided boots, and a white apron. She sits in the rocking-chair,
      watching the cheap alarm-clock fretfully. Outside a boy is heard calling
      "Last Edishun." She rises hastily, feels on the mantelpiece for her purse,
      opens the door centre and buys a paper from the boy who appears through
      the doorway. She closes door, sits centre and spreads the paper on the
      table, rises again and gets spectacle-case from mantelpiece. She sits with
      spectacles on and rapidly goes through the paper seeking some particular
      item.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door centre opens and Margaret Shawcross enters. She is young, dark,
      with a face beautiful in expression rather than feature. It is the face of
      an idealist, one who would go through fire and water for the faith that is
      in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is a school teacher, speaking with an educated voice in a slightly
      apparent northern accent, dressed neatly and serviceably.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>arside turns eagerly as she enters and is disappointed on seeing
      Margaret.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. Gar</b>. Oh, it's you. I thought it might be&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>closing door, sympathetically</i>). Yes. But it's too early to
      expect Peter back yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>with some truculence</i>). He'll not be long. He's always said
      he'd let his mother be the first to hear the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>gently</i>). You don't mind my being here to hear it with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>rising and putting spectacles back on mantelpiece, speaking
      ungraciously</i>). No, you've got a right to hear it too, Margaret. (<i>Margaret
      picks up paper.</i>) I can't find anything in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Peter said the results come out too late for the evening papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. He never told me. (<i>Margaret folds paper on table.</i>) I'm glad
      though. There's no one else <i>'</i>ull know a-front of me. He'll bring
      the good news home himself. He's coming now as fast as train and car <i>'</i>ull
      bring him. (<i>Sitting in rocking-chair.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Yes. He knows we're waiting here, we two who care for Peter more than
      anything on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>giving her a jealous glance</i>). I wish he'd come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Try to be calm, Mrs. Garside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>irritably</i>). Calm? How can I be calm? I'm on edge till I
      know. (<i>Rocking her chair quickly.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>trying to soothe her</i>). It isn't as if he can't try again if
      he's not through this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>confidently, keeping her chair still</i>). He'll have no need
      to try again. I've a son and his name this night is Peter Garside, b.a. I
      know he's through.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>sitting in chair lift of table</i>). Then if you're sure&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Yes. I know I'm a fidget. I want to hear it from his own lips.
      He's worked so hard he can't fail. (<i>Accusingly.</i>) You don't believe
      me, Margaret. You're not sure of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>with elbows on table and head on hands</i>). I'm fearful of the
      odds against him&mdash;the chances that the others have and he hasn't. <i>Peter's</i>
      to work for his living. <i>They're</i> free to study all day long. (<i>Rising,
      enthusiastically.</i>) Oh, if he does it, what a triumph for our class.
      Peter Garside, the Board School boy, the working engineer, keeping himself
      and you, and studying at night for his degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>dogmatically</i>). The odds don't count. I know Peter. Peter's
      good enough for any odds. You doubt him, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. No. I've seen him work. I've worked with him till he distanced me and
      left me far behind. He knows enough to pass, to pass above them all&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Yes, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. But examinations are a fearful hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Not to Peter. He's fighting for his class, he's showing them he's
      the better man. He can work with his hands and they can't, and he can work
      with his brain as well as the best of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. He'll do it. It may not be this time, but he'll do it in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>obstinately</i>). This time, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I do hope so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>looking at the clock</i>). Do you think there's been a
      breakdown on the cars?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. No, no.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>rising anxiously</i>). He said seven, and it's after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>trying to soothe her</i>). Not much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>pacing about</i>). Why doesn't he come? (<i>Stopping short.</i>)
      Where do people go to find out if there's been an accident? It's the
      police station, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Oh, there's no need&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Peter Garside bursts in through centre door and closes it behind him
      as he speaks. He is 23, cleanshaven, fair, sturdily built, with a large,
      loose mouth, strong jaw, and square face, dressed in a cheap tweed suit,
      wearing a red tie.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>breathlessly</i>). I've done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>going to him; he puts his arm round her and pats her back,
      while she hides her face against his chest</i>). My boy, my boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I've done it, mother. (<i>Looking proudly at Margaret.</i>) I'm an
      honours man of Midlandton University.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. First class, Peter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. First Class. (<i>Gently disengaging himself from Mrs. Garside.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>standing by his left, looking up at him</i>). I knew, I knew
      it, Peter. I had the faith in you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>hanging his cap behind the door right, then coming back to
      centre. Margaret is standing on the hearthrug</i>). Ah, little mother,
      what a help that faith has been to me. I couldn't disappoint a faith like
      yours. I had to win. Mother, Margaret, I've done it. Done it. Oh, I think
      I'm not quite sane to-night. This room seems small all of a sudden. I want
      to leap, to dance, and I know I'd break my neck against the ceiling if I
      did. Peter Garside, b.a. (<i>Approaching Margaret.</i>) Margaret, tell me
      I deserve it. <i>You</i> know what it means to me. The height of my
      ambition. The crown, the goal, my target reached at last. Margaret, isn't
      it a great thing that I've done?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>taking both his hands</i>). A great thing, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, but I was lucky in my papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. No, you just deserve it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>dropping her hands</i>). Up to the end I didn't know. I thought
      I'd failed. And here I'm through first class. I've beaten men I never
      hoped to equal. I've called myself a swollen-headed fool for dreaming to
      compete with them, and now&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Now you've justified my faith. I never doubted you&mdash;like
      Margaret did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>looking from her to Margaret</i>). Margaret did?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I didn't dare to hope for this, Peter&mdash;at a first attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>contemptuously</i>). She didn't dare. But I did. I dared,
      Peter, I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>putting his arm over her shoulder</i>). Oh, mother, mother! But
      Margaret was right, if I hadn't had such luck in the papers I&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>slipping from him and going to where her cape and bonnet hang
      on the door right</i>). It wasn't luck. Even Margaret said you deserved it
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Even Margaret! (<i>Seeing her putting cape on.</i>) You're not
      going out, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>with determination</i>). Yes, I am. There's others besides
      Margaret doubted you. I'm going to tell them all. I'm going to be the
      first to spread the news. And won't it spread! Like murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Margaret sits l.c.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, yes. It'll spread fast enough. They may know already.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>turning with her hand on the centre door latch</i>). How could
      they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. News travels fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. But you haven't told anyone else. Have you, Peter? (<i>Reproachfully.</i>)
      You said you'd let me be the first to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I met O'Callagan on his way to the Club. He asked me. I couldn't
      refuse to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>energetically</i>). He'd no right to meet you. A dreamy
      wastrel like O'Callagan to know before your mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. He'll only tell the men at the Club, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>opening door</i>). And I'll tell the women. They're going to
      know the kind of son I've borne. I'm a proud woman this night, and all
      Belinda Street is going to know I've cause to be. (<i>Sniffing.</i>)
      O'Callagan indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Exit Mrs. Garside.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. And now, Margaret? (<i>He stands centre behind table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>looking up and holding out her hand across table; she takes his,
      bending</i>). Oh, my dear, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Are you pleased with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Pleased!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>rising</i>). Yes. We've done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. You, not we. My hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. We, Margaret, we. I'm no hero. I owe it all to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>rising</i>). You owe it to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You inspired me. You helped me on. You kept me at it when my
      courage failed. When I wanted to slack you came and worked with me. It was
      your idea from the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. My idea but your deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>sitting centre, behind table</i>). I've had dreams of this.
      Dreams of success. I never thought it would come. It was there on the
      horizon&mdash;a far-off nebulous dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>standing right</i>). It's a reality to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. It's a reality to day. I've done the task you set me. I've
      proved my class as good as theirs. That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I wanted you to win, Peter.

      <b>Peter</b>. I've won because you wanted it, because after I won I knew that you&mdash;&mdash;
      (<i>Rising.</i>) Has it been wearisome to wait, Margaret? I had the work,
      lectures, study. You had the tedious clays of teaching idiotic
      middle-class facts to idiotic middle-class children, and evenings when you
      ought to have had me and didn't because I couldn't lose a single precious
      moment's chance of study.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. That's clean forgotten. To-night is worth it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. To-night, and the future, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>solemnly</i>). Yes, the future, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. This night was always in my dreams. The night when I should come to
      you and say, Margaret Shawcross, this have I done for you, because you
      wanted it. Was it well done, Margaret?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Nobly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. And the labourer is worthy of his hire? I ask for my reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>shaking her head</i>). I can give you no reward that's big
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You can give the greatest prize on earth. We ought to have been
      married long ago. I've kept you waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. That had to be. They won't have married women teachers at the
      Midlandton High School. I couldn't burden you until this fight was fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. And now, Margaret?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Now I'm ready&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. More if's?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. A very little one. If you've money to keep us three. No going short
      for mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You trust me, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>giving hand</i>). Yes, Peter, I trust you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>bursting with thoughts</i>). There's my journalism. This degree
      <i>'</i>ull give me a lift at that. I shall get lecture engagements too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>alarmed</i>). Peter, you didn't do it for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I did it for you. But I mean to enjoy the fruits of all this work.
      Public speaking's always been a joy to me. You don't know the glorious
      sensation of holding a crowd in the hollow of your hand, mastering it,
      doing what you like with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>sadly</i>). I hoped you'd given up speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I haven't spoken lately because I'd other things to do. I haven't
      given it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. You did too much before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You don't know the fascination of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>bracing herself for a tussle</i>). I know the fascination's
      fatal. I saw it growing on you&mdash;this desire to speak, to be the
      master of a mob. I hoped I'd cured you of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Cured me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I thought I'd given you a higher aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. And <i>that</i> was why you urged this study on me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Margaret! Why? (<i>Backing from, her, and sitting centre during her
      speech.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I've seen men ruined by this itch to speak. You know them. Men we had
      great hopes of in the movement. Men we thought would be real leaders of
      the people. And they spoke, and spoke, and soon said all they had to say,
      became mere windbags trading on a reputation till people tired and turned
      to some new orator. Don't be one of these, Peter. You've solider grit than
      they. The itch to speak is like the itch to drink, except that it's
      cheaper to talk yourself tipsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You ask a great thing of me, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>sitting right</i>) What shall I see of you if you're out speaking
      every night? You pitied me just now because you had to close your door
      against me while you studied. I could bear that for the time. But this
      other thing, married and widowed at once, with you out at your work all
      day and away night after night&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. But I shan't always be working in the daytime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>alarmed</i>). Not work! Peter&mdash;they haven't dismissed you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, no. I'm safe if anyone is safe. No one is, of course, but I'm
      as safe as man can be. I'm a first-elass workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I know that, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. So do they. They'll not sack me. I might sack them some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. But&mdash;how shall we live?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>impatiently</i>). Oh, not yet. I'm speaking of the future. Don't
      you see? I'm not content to be a workman all my life. I ought to make a
      living easily by writing and&mdash;and speaking if you'll let me. Then I
      could be with you all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>looking straight in front of her</i>). Have I set fire to this
      train?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You don't suppose a B.A. means to stick to manual labour all his
      life, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Oh, dear! This wasn't my idea at all. I wanted you to win your degree
      for the honour of the thing, to show them what a working engineer could
      do. Cease to be a workman and you confess another, worse motive. It's as
      though you only passed to make a profit for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I can't help being ambitious. I wasn't till you set me on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. If you listened to me then, listen to me now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>pushing his chair hack and rising</i>). I might have a career. (<i>Crossing
      to fireplace.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b> (<i>still sitting</i>). And I might have a husband. I don't want to
      marry a career, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>looking into fire, his back to Margaret</i>). I've already got a
      local reputation as a speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Then make one as a writer. I know you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. The other's easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. It's not like you to choose the easy path.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I've worked so hard. I did think that now I might have some reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. You've won your degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>acquiescent</i>). Oh, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. And&mdash;I'm ready, Peter. (<i>Slight pause.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>turning</i>). Yes. You've conquered me. I'll fight ambition
      down. It shall be as you wish, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>rising and going to him</i>). Peter, oh, my dear, dear Peter! You
      make me feel I don't do right. Oh, but I know. I know. Speaking's so
      deadly dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I promise not to speak. I'll write. I'll stick to engineering, and
      we'll have our evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. You make me very happy, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. When are you going to make me happy, Margaret?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. As soon as my lord pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Your lord will be pleased in a month.

    </p>

      in being men of leisure, sons of wealthy parents with nothing to do but
      study. Don't talk about your luck&mdash;(<i>bitterly</i>)&mdash;the luck

      got hold of me and urged me on. Injustice! Tyranny! The consciousness of
      class. The knowledge that in the eyes of my well-to-do competitors I was
      an inferior animal. My hands are rough with toil, the toil they batten on,
      and so they mocked at me for daring to compete with them&mdash;a man with
      a trade. They know now what a working man can do with his brain. They

      <b>Jones</b>. Nor we couldn't neither. We gave it up last night and called
      another meeting at the Club to-night. And there we sat, the whole
      executive, no better than a parcel of tongue-tied fools, when O'Callagan
      bursts in and tells us&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>

      [<i>Margaret shrinks back still further.</i>
    </p>

      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>going round to him</i>). Peter! My son a Member of Parliament!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>repulsing her</i>). No, no, I'm not worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. We're the best judges of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>firmly</i>). I'm too young. I'd be the youngest man in the
      Labour Party.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Someone's got to be that. They need young blood. There's too much
      antideluvian trades unionism about the old gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. It's a queer thing you do be saying, and you without a grey hair to
      your head. It's a queer thing to hear a young man making moan beeause he's
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>appealingly</i>). Peter!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I don't know. I never thought of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Think of it now. We've to act sharp if we're to do any good at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>still wondering</i>). And you've come officially to offer it to
      me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>roughly</i>). Of course we have. Do you think we're playing with
      the thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. It's&mdash;it's awfully sudden. When do you want my answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. Now. (<i>Seeing Peter's distress, more kindly.</i>) To-night, anyhow.
      The whole thing <i>'</i>ull be over in six weeks. We've little enough time
      in all conscience to create an organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. And if I say&mdash;no?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. Then one of the murdering blood-suckers that live upon our labour
      <i>'</i>ull get the seat, and it won't matter either way which side wins,
      for it's all one to the working man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. It's you or nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>appealing</i>). Lad, you'll not say no. I don't say you'll never
      get another chance, beeause B.A.s are sort of scarce in the Amalgamated
      Society of Engineers. But I do say this. We want you. You've got a call to
      a high place and a high duty. Are you going to fail us in our need?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. We want you for another nail in the coffin of capitalism, another
      link in the golden chain that's dragging us up from slavery the way we'll
      be free men the day that chain's complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>smiling</i>). And I'd be a nine-carat link, Denis. I'm made of
      baser stuff than the great leaders who compose that chain. I'm not worthy
      to aspire to a seat by their side in Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. There's such a vice as over-modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. Nay, I like you better for being modest. You'd like us to go out and
      eome back in an hour or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Say yes to them, Peter. Tell them you'll be a Member of
      Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Members of Parliament need electing first, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. And are you doubting that you'll be elected? You've only to say
      you'll stand, and you can practise putting M.P. after your name this
      night, for you'll have need to write it certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>going to Margaret</i>). Margaret, what shall I say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. You must decide this for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>coming forward a little reluctantly</i>). Yes, Peter. You must
      decide. No one can help you there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Won't you tell me what you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>firmly</i>). Not now. No other mind than yours can make this
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>adrift</i>). But, Margaret, you've always given me advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>jealously</i>). She wants to hold you back. She's never had
      the faith in you that others have. She'd like to tell you now you're not
      good enough for Parliament only there's too many here to give her the lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Mother, mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Oh, yes, I dare say, put Margaret first, Margaret who doesn't
      believe in you, in front of all the rest of us who know Parliament's not
      good enough for you. It's the House of Lords you should be in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I hope not so bad as that, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. We'll be taking a stroll round the houses, and come in again
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>turning to them</i>). No. Don't go. I'll give you my answer now.
      I've decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. Well. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'll stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. (<i>shaking his hand</i>). Good lad!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. It's destroyed I am with joy, and me after thinking he wasn't going
      to stand at all. You'll be elected surely, and we the nearer by another
      step to that great glittering dawn that's coming to bring peace and
      happiness to&mdash;&mdash;

      going to the Club to beat up recruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. We're all coming, Karl. We're not going into this with our hands in
      our pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>making for his cap</i>). Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>stopping him</i>). Not you, Peter. You've earned a rest to-night.
      You begin to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Rest! I shan't rest till after the election.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. You've to keep your strength for the street corners. We'll do the
      donkey work. Clerking's all some of us are fit for. (<i>Glancing at
      O'Callagan.</i>) You can draft your election address if you want something
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. You'll want every ounce of strength. Ramsden's done us a good turn by
      resigning in the summer time. They can have every hall in the town and
      welcome. But open-air speaking night after night&mdash;well, look to your
      lungs. We'll watch the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'm in your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. That's right. Take it easy now. You'll have to sprint at the finish.
      Now, comrades. (<i>Opening door, centre.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. Good night, all.

    <p>

      [<i>Peter holds door open and sees them go, he, Margaret, and Mrs. Garside

      if dazed, passing his hand across his forehead.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. My God! It's like a dream. I can't get used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. You'll get used to it fast enough. It's always an easy thing to
      take your natural state in life. You were born to be great. (<i>Viciously.</i>)
      However much some folk <i>'</i>ud like to keep you down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. I suppose I shall settle to it. (<i>Coming to chair right and
      sitting, Mrs. Garside is to his left, Margaret his right.</i>) In a few
      days it <i>'</i>ull seem matter of fact enough to be Labour candidate for
      the division. But it hasn't got me that way yet. Margaret, when you set me
      on to study for my B.A., you little thought it was going to lead to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>slowly</i>). No. I didn't think it would lead to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>sharply</i>). And you're not well pleased it has. Some people
      can't stand the sight of other folk's success.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>protesting</i>). Mother, mother, without Margaret this would
      never have happened to me. I owe it all to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>sceptically</i>). Because she told you to study? It's a proper
      easy job to tell someone else to do a thing. A fine lot easier than doing
      it yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Come, mother, I can't have you quarrelling with Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>sulkily</i>). What does she want to go and discourage you for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. She didn't discourage me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. She wouldn't say a word for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. She will now. Won't you, Margaret?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. What do you want me to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>surprised</i>). Say what you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Then I say this: Go on and prosper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>relieved</i>). Ah! You couldn't wish me anything but well. You
      see, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>grimly</i>). Yes, but you don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Don't what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. You don't sec what she means.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>confidently smiling at Margaret</i>). Oh, Margaret means what
      she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. And more. She doesn't want you to go into Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>puzzled, looking at Margaret</i>). Doesn't what&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?
      (<i>Slightly pausing.</i>) Speak, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. No. I don't want you to go into Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>triumphantly</i>). What did I tell you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. But Margaret, why not? Don't you see what a chance it is? Take it,
      and I go up, up, Fortune, Fame, anything&mdash;the prospects are
      tremendous. Miss it, and I sink baek to obscurity. You can't want me to
      miss a chance like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I wanted to be married to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. That's it, Peter. That's your Margaret all over. All she cares
      about is herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>ignoring her&mdash;to Margaret</i>). Nothing's going to
      interfere with that. Nothing on earth. You needn't fear. We're to be
      married in a month. Exactly as we fixed just now. A month? It'll come in
      the thick of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. We can't be married while the election's on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>thinking aloud, enthusiastically</i>). Oh, but we must. We must.
      I hadn't thought of that. Weddings are always popular. See what an
      advertisement it will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>quietly</i>). We won't use our love to advertise your
      candidature, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. To hear you talk, it might be something you're ashamed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. It's throwing away a golden opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I'm sorry, Peter. But I can't do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Won't, you mean. You want to see him defeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>with quiet force</i>). I shall work till I drop to help him on to
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. You'll help best by doing what he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I really think you might, Margaret. It's not a new plan. I'm only
      asking you to carry out the arrangement you made this very evening. You
      didn't object then, I can't see what your scruple is now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. If you can't see for yourself that it's vulgar and hideous and
      horrible to drag our love into the glare of an election, I'm afraid I
      can't help you to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I don't see it. Love's not a hole-and-corner business. Why
      shouldn't everybody know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. All who matter know already.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Only our own circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. It doesn't concern the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>arguing hotly</i>). Except as an advertisement. We shan't have
      too much money to spend on printers' bills. We ean't buy hoardings like
      the capitalist parties. And here's a glorious advertisement simply going
      begging. We can have it at the cost of your forgetting some imaginary
      scruple of delicacy. Elections aren't delicate affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. No. But our love is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. If your love's so finicky it can't stand daylight, it's not worth
      much. A love like that <i>'</i>ull not last long.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You're right there, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>eagerly</i>). She wants to hold you back, she'd like to see
      you tied to engineering all your life. For why? She's wild because you're
      going up in the world. She knows she's not fit to go up with you, so she's
      trying to keep you where you are. That's why she refuses to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I don't refuse to help. I'm going to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes, anything except the only way that's helpful. I don't want
      other help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. You can't go without it. You can't stop me working for the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Yes, and you'd work harder for any other candidate than Peter. I
      know you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Not harder, but certainly with a better will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>soberly</i>). Margaret, you're standing in my way. Oh, I owe a
      lot to you. I don't forget it. But... But a man has to rely on his own
      judgment. If I took your advice, I'd wreck my career. You've always
      underrated me. You thought I wouldn't get my degree. I did get my degree.
      And I'll prove you wrong again. I'll be M.P. before six weeks are out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I say again: Go on and prosper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. And she means you can prosper without her, and a good riddance
      too, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Do you mean that, Margaret?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I think we'll wait a little, Peter. You've other things to think of
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You said that when I started studying.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I say it again now when you're starting electioneering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>losing temper</i>). And after that there'll be something else
      and something after that, and so on, till Doomsday <i>'</i>ull see us
      still unmarried. I begin to think you never mean to marry me.
    </p>

      <b>Mrs. G</b>. It's about time you did begin to think it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>suffering</i>). Oh, Peter, why won't you understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Because you're not reasonable. (<i>Slight pause.</i>) Tell me this.
      Do you think I'm not fit for Parliament?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>painfully</i>). Yes, dear. I do.
    </p>

      you're not dear to me.

      she was Almighty God.

      you've no love&mdash;&mdash;

      and ask your pardon.

      <b>Mar</b>. I can't marry you in a month.
    </p>

      <b>Peter</b>. A dictionary's useful. People like to read long words. It looks
      erudite, and costs nothing.

      <i>Gladys Mottram is sitting on the Chesterfield reading a novel. She is
      in evening dress, a pretty, flirtatious, empty-headed girl, bored with her
      daily life and seizing eagerly on any distraction. Freddie Mottram, her
      brother, is 30, and conceals real kindness behind his flippant manner. He
      doesn't go deep and he likes money, but he is on good terms with the world
      and doesn't mind a little trouble or even unconventionality to put the
      world on good terms with him. He is fair, with fair moustache, and his
      figure is that of the ex-athlete who could still give a good account of
      himself. He leans back in the arm-chair, yawning and consulting his watch,
      glancing at Gladys, entrenched behind her book, again yawning and making
      up his mind to address her.</i>

    <p>
      <b>Fred</b> (<i>nursing a grievance</i>). I say, Gladys, how much longer do you
      expect me to wait?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. (<i>looking up from her book, calmly</i>). Till Mr. Garside goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. And he hasn't come yet. Just when I particularly want to go out,
      too. It's all very well for the governor to be civil to him. He's got to.
      But I do bar doing the honours myself to a horny-handed son of toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. (<i>putting her book beside her, face downwards. With an air of
      resignation</i>). You don't particularly want to go out. You're only going
      to the Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. (<i>seriously</i>). But I particularly want to go to the Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. You go every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Every night isn't my lucky night. Thursday is. I always win on
      Thursdays. The governor ought to do his own dirty work. He's Mayor, not I.
      Cutting his duty, I call it, being away to-night just when I'm bound to
      make money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. He'll be here when he's ready. He's going to be late on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Very much on purpose. Yes. There you've got it. He had Rankin and
      Beverley here to dinner together. Quite right, too. Rankin's a Radical
      rotter, but he's a gentleman. When it comes to Garside the governor shirks
      and leaves it to us. Why on earth he wants to ask a Labour candidate here
      at all simply floors me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. He has to treat them all alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Then he should have had Garside to dinner, and given us some sport
      over the asparagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. That wasn't necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. And this isn't necessary. Rankin and Beverley, by all means. They're
      probables. But why waste time on an outsider like Garside? It'll only
      swell his head to be our guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. He isn't an outsider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. You don't say the governor's taking him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. He's taking him very seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b> (<i>horrified</i>). Oh, I say. No. It's absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Garside's making headway fast. He's a fine speaker, and he's
      popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. A mechanic a fine speaker! Rot! Who says so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I for one. I've heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. You have! It's a quaint taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. More than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. (<i>sarcastically</i>). Making a hobby of it? (<i>Seriously.</i>)
      Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. In the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>, (<i>genuinely shocked</i>). You've been listening to a tub-thumper
      at street corners? I say, hang it, Gladys, there are things people don't
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. The first time was an accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. The second was a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>rising, and speaking enthusiastically</i>). I went again because
      I admired the man. I liked to hear that ringing voice, to be one of that
      wild enthusiastic crowd bewitched by the spell of his personality. He saw
      me too. I stood at the back of the crowd, but he saw me and he spoke for
      me for me. Our eyes met, and I know he spoke for me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>, (<i>sitting and leaning back, fanning his face</i>). Why didn't you
      warn me? I didn't know I was to meet my future brother-in-law to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Don't be absurd, Freddie. (<i>Sitting again.</i>) It's because he's
      doing so well that father asked him here, and we've to keep him as long as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>, (<i>looking at watch</i>). My ducats, oh, my ducats! Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Because every moment that he's prevented from speaking is a loss to
      him and a gain to us. As Mayor, father's supposed to be neutral, at the
      election, so that gives him an excuse to entertain Garside and spoil his
      speaking for one night, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. That's a bit tricky.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. All's fair in war.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. And love, Gladys, and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Don't be sillier than you can help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Besides, they'll have others to keep the ball rolling while he's
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. There's a firebrand of a woman speaking every night who's about as
      popular as he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>, (<i>interested</i>). A woman? Is she good-looking?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. You wouldn't. You'd only eyes for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. She doesn't speak on the same platforms with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Don't blame her, either. Only one star turn to each show, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Anyhow, father's instructions are to keep Garside here till he comes
      home, if we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. All right. Tell Timson to lock him up in the pantry and keep him
      there till the election's over.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Afraid that's too crude, Freddie. I'll do my best to hold him for
      to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Oh? Be careful. Flirtation's a risky game even when both sides know
      the rules. It's always apt to end in marriage; and that chap won't know
      the rules. Much better lock him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Kidnapping's out of date.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Oh, you want him to get in. He's fascinated you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>tartly</i>). That's doubtless why I've been canvassing for Mr.
      Beverley all day, while you've been watching a cricket match.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Hang it, Glad, someone's got to support-county cricket. I did a
      jolly plucky thing to-day. Wore old Beverley's colours and nearly got
      mobbed in the bar by a beastly gang of Radicals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. You shouldn't go into bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. And you shouldn't hang about street corners with a set of
      Socialists. Serve you right if you'd got your pocket picked. I'd rather be
      an open drinker than a secret revolutionist any day.

      <b>Lady M</b>. (<i>severely</i>). Yours. I don't complain of your holding
      heterodox views. It is a regrettable fact that many young women of to-day
      hold alarmingly lax opinions. But they keep their views to themselves.
      They confine them to their own circle. It has been left to you to proclaim
      publicly at street corners your loose morality, to&mdash;&mdash;

      Socialist.

    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. You spoke of loose morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lady M</b>. (<i>curtly</i>). Same thing. Do you admit to publicly advocating
      Socialism?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Certainly. You publicly advocate Tariff Reform. Why shouldn't I
      advocate Socialism?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lady M</b>. The cases are hardly parallel. The one is respectable, the other
      isn't. However, you're not here to argue with me. You have to earn your
      living. An orphan, I understand.
    </p>
    <p>

      <b>Lady M</b>. You've the more reason to walk warily. (<i>Kindly.</i>) Now,
      you're young, and you're ignorant, and I'm ready to overlook this. I could
      have you dismissed at once, but I've no doubt you'll be a good girl after
      this little talk. Good night, Miss Shawcross.

    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Good night, Lady Mottram. (<i>She moves towards door. Freddie opens
      it, she turns back.</i>) No, I won't go like this. You'd have the right to
      tell me I deceived you. (<i>Freddie closes door and stands centre.</i>) I
      can't take your warning, Lady Mottram. (<i>Lady M. rises.</i>) I dare say
      it's kindly meant. I thank you for that. But as for stopping speaking,
      working heart and soul for the cause that's all in all to me, I can't do
      that.

    </p>

      at stake. I say nothing about your immortal soul, which is endangered if
      it's not already lost.

      <b>Mar</b>. Suppose you leave my soul out, Lady Mottram.

      My employment <i>is</i> in your hands. You have the power to take that
      from me.

      power.

      my mother, I should just like to interpolate the remark that she
      invariably means what she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>coldly</i>). Thank you. I haven't worked for Socialism without
      knowing the risks I took. There's nothing unusual in this. Since
      Socialism's been the bogey of the employing class, dismissal for
      Socialists is an everyday occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lady M</b>. (<i>mildly angered</i>). This is too much. To associate <i>me</i>
      with cowardly employers who abuse their power, when my only object is to
      secure respectability in our teaching staff.

      Mottram?

      <b>Lady M</b>. Till Miss Allinson can replace you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Till then I can go on contaminating my pupils! However, to replace me
      won't take an hour. Unemployed teachers aren't scarce.

      <b>Mar</b>. Let me go, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Yes. I say. I know I'm being assinine. I am rather an ass. But I'm a
      genial sort of ass, and if there's one thing I ean't stand it's one woman
      being beastly to another. Women are the limit. (<i>Rapidly, as Margaret
      shows impatience.</i>) What I mean is, can I do anything for you?

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>, (<i>with a stronger note of seriousness</i>). No, you're not going
      till I let you. The mater's made it hard enough. That's the worst of
      women. They won't be sportsmen. Mind you, I'm not blaming her. Swop
      positions and you'd do it yourself. But you've lost your job. That's an
      idiotic thing to do now. As if any footling politics were worth a tinker's
      cuss!

      soul, and I hate to see people in distress. The mater's got you down. Foul
      blow, too. Hitting below the belt, to sack you without a character. What
      are you going to do about it, Miss Shaweross?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I don't know yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Let me talk to some Johnnie at the Club, and make him take you into
      his office.
    </p>

      <b>Mar</b>. Why should you? And do you think anybody will have me without a
      character?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. I'll fix that all right. Only it'll be an office.
    </p>

      <b>Mar</b>. I can typewrite.

    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. By Jove! What a brainy chap you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I don't know why you're doing this, but I'll work my fingers to the
      bone if you can get me work where they'll not mind my principles.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Oh, don't wet blanket me. I'm only trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I'm sorry, Mr. Mottram. Your friend will find me a hard worker.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. What part?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. The working. Bad form to make the pace hotter than the regular rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I thought offices were places for hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. I dare say you're right. I expect that's why the office men I know
      spend so much time at the Club, out of work's way.

      <b>Mar</b>. Mr. Mottram, why are you doing this?

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>, (<i>offering hand again, emphatically</i>). Good evening, Mr.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>carelessly, just touching his hand</i>). Oh, good evening. Sir
      Jasper is officially neutral, sir. But he is actually chairman of the
      Employers' Federation, and, as such, our bitterest enemy.

    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. By the way, you're here yourself, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I am paying an official visit to the Mayor. It's different with
      this lady. She works for me&mdash;ostentatiously. She's supposed to be
      addressing a meeting for me at this moment. Instead, I find her here,
      playing the traitor and betraying me to my political enemies.
    </p>

      Does yours often bolt like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. That's not very convincing. (<i>Brushing him aside.</i>) Excuse me,

      have you to say for yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Quite right, too. Some things are too silly to reply to.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

      lady only makes bad worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Good Lord! I always said politicians were people who hadn't the

      are serious-minded.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Do please.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. It is romantic, Lady Mottram. I didn't think such beauty could be
      earthly. It came upon me just as I stood speaking at a street corner one
      night, a face on the outskirts of my audience. I was tired and it gave me
      strength. My voice was failing, but it rang out fresh again to reach those
      ears. I've seen it many times since then, that angel's face with a halo,
      always at the fringe of the crowd, always an inspiration, eyes that
      yearned to mine across the sea of caps and drew my very soul into my
      words. I thought it was a dream. Could the same clay that moulded me be
      shaped to this vision? Until to-night I didn't know such women could
      exist.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Lady M</b>. She'd be flattered if she heard you now.

      wonderful face who's been inspiring his speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>, (<i>sitting r.c.</i>). Oh, yes? A face that launched a thousand
      speeches? Bit of a responsibility for any face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lady M</b>. And who is she, Mr. Garside?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I didn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. What a pity. She'll never know what she's been to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I think she knows now, Miss Mottram.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Fair Unknown inspires your speeches, your speeches inspire electors,
      electors elect you, and it'll be Garsidc, M.P., when it ought to be Fair
      Unknown, M.P.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. No, but I hope to shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. You must let me show you round. You'll feel strange at first.
    </p>
    <p>

      me conquering London I know which will win.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. Going to be one of our conquerors, eh?

      <b>Peter</b>. I mean to try. I've got ambitions.
    </p>

      like money.

    <p>
      <b>Fred</b>. What's the recipe?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, you begin by journalism and lecture engagements.

      <b>Fred</b>. And that's the royal road to wealth? Mother, why wasn't I brought up
      to be a Labour member! This solves the problem of what shall we do with

      toughening my epidermis, Miss Mottram. I'm not afraid of ridicule.

      <b>Peter</b>. I think you're playing with me now. I know you didn't play then. We
      had reality there in the street. I'll make you tell me yet you meant the
      things your eyes spoke to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Make! This is strange language for a drawing-room, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'm not talking to the drawing-room miss. She's a stranger to me.
      I'm talking to the real woman, the woman I knew outside there, stripped of
      the veil of lies you try to hide behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. But you don't know me. I never met you till to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I didn't know your name until to-night. What do names matter? Your
      eyes had blazed into my soul.

      take your hat off in a lady's presence?

      kick something.

      We've done our best, marking time, promising them every minute you'd come&mdash;and
      you don't come. It's serious. They're impatient. They don't want us
      others. They want you&mdash;(<i>sarcastically</i>)&mdash;silver-tongued
      Garside. We can't hold them much longer. There'll be a riot if you don't
      turn up.

      shan't be long.

    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. I'll report you to the Committee if you don't come at once.

      I'm busy.
    </p>

      crowd's like when it gets out of hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I tell you I'm coming. The longer you stay the longer it'll be
      before I get there.
    </p>

      for you?

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>standing centre</i>). Every night I can make myself the master
      of a mob. It's no new joy to me to feel I've got them there in the hollow
      of my hand. I can't speak with you every night. That's why I didn't go.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Wise?

      <b>Peter</b>. I won't spoil my chances of speaking with you.
    </p>
    <p>

      stir them up to mischief.

      <b>Glad</b>. You don't let me shuffle off responsibility.

      and I'm a working man.

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>sitting in left arm-chair, facing her&mdash;confidentially</i>).
      I haven't had an easy hour since Peter brought me. You wouldn't believe
      the prices they charge me in the shops if I want a chop or a bit of steak
      for Peter's tea. Dinner he calls it now, though how it can be dinner at
      seven of an evening I don't know. Thieves, that's what they are. Not
      shopkeepers. You mustn't mind me running on, I haven't a soul I know to
      talk to here. It's a pleasure to see you, I'm sure. And the streets! I'm
      feared for my life if I go out. I know I'll be knocked down and brought
      home dead. Eh, London's an awful place, but it's Peter's home now, and his
      home's mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. But you'll get used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. I doubt I'll never get used to this. I'm too old to change, and
      Peter moves so fast. What's fit for him one day isn't good enough the
      next. The waste's enough to frighten you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. You must be very proud of your son, Mrs. Garside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>with conviction, dropping her querulous tone</i>). He's
      something to be proud of. I'm the mother of a great man. You can't open a
      newspaper without you see his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. You've seen it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Often.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>rising and coming to table</i>). But not all. I've got them
      all here. I cut them out, reports of his speeches, and paste them in this
      book. (<i>Crosses to sofa with press-cutting book and sits by Gladys.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. His speeches in Parliament?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>with fine scorn</i>). Peter doesn't waste his words on
      Parliament. He goes direct to the people&mdash;addressing meetings up and
      down the country. (<i>Glowing with pride.</i>) They fight to get him. Pity
      is he can't split himself in bits and be in six places at once. Two
      guineas a speech he gets&mdash;and expenses,&mdash;more sometimes. That's
      what they think of him, Miss Mottram. That's my son. (<i>Pointing to a
      heading in the hook.</i>) Silver-tongued Garside. That's what they call
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Yes, I see. (<i>She turns a page.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>looking, bending round Gladys</i>). Oh, no, not that. I
      oughtn't to have pasted that in. It's an attack on him in one of our own
      papers. They call him something he didn't like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>reading</i>). Platitudinous Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. It's all their spite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I suppose all politicians make enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Oh, he's not afraid of his real enemies. The capitalists can call
      him what they like. They do, too, and the more the better, Peter says. But
      that's different. Mean things, attacking their own side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>absently</i>). Yes. (<i>Putting book down.</i>) And this is
      where he prepares his speeches. (<i>Crossing to table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Why, this row's all dictionaries.

    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Peter says people like long words. He writes his article at that
      desk. Peter's printed in the paper every week.
    </p>
    <p>

      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>sitting in the revolving chair and facing Mrs. Garside, standing
      centre</i>). Have you no help?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. Me? Nay. I couldn't abide the thought of a strange woman doing <i>'</i>owt
      for Peter. I've cared for him all his life, and I'll go on caring for him
      until he's put another woman in my place. Peter's wife won't be of my
      class. It'll be my duty then to keep myself out of her sight, and a hard
      job I'll find it, too, but I was never one to shirk.
    </p>

      who, she is, she'll be doing well for herself when she marries my Peter.

    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. You think she will marry him, then?

      <b>Fred</b>. It's a profitable game when you can run to this after six months of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. It doesn't afford it. Did you ever hear of the hire system? A man
      who means to be a big success simply must have a decent address and be on
      the telephone. People won't believe in you if you're content to hide
      yourself up a mean street.

      quarterly by the Bank of England. Security's my mark.

      I've the knack of getting what I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Don't you find continuous success monotonous?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>smiling</i>). They're such precious small successes. I'm on the

      the faintest idea what we want to do with our lives.

      <b>Glad</b>. But you denounce them.

      <b>Peter</b>. What I denounce is luxury for the few and penury for the many. We
      want to level up, not level down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I've heard something like that before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Probably. It's not my business to be original. If I tried to be
      lofty I'd be talking above the heads of my audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>puzzled</i>). I wonder how much is sincere!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Sincere? I'm a professional advocate. I take a tiny grain of truth,
      dress it up in a pompous parade of rhetoric and deliver it in the manner
      of an oracle and the accent of a cheapjack. It's a question of making my
      points tell. Sincerity doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>rising</i>). If I turned myself into a human gramophone, I
      shouldn't boast about it, Mr. Garside. It's not <i>very</i> creditable to

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>rising</i>). Creditable? If I fooled them from Fleet Street
      they'd make me a peer. The public likes to be fooled. They know I'm
      fooling them. They pay me to go on fooling them. Some men live by selling
      adulterated beer. I live by selling adulterated truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. And neither makes an honest livelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. No, neither your father the brewer, nor I the demagogue. But I'm
      being frank with you, Miss Mottram. Between us two there's not to be
      pretence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Why am <i>I</i> honoured with your confidences?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Because you have a right to know. I do these things to make money.
      I want money because&mdash;because of the hope that was born in me when
      your eyes first met mine across the crowd in Midlandton.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>after a slight pause</i>). Mr. Garside, I&mdash;I think I ought
      to go. My brother only left me because he thought your mother would be
      here.

    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>going towards door right</i>). Shall I bring her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. She's gone to bed.

    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>checking him</i>). But not from my conscience, Mr. Garside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, conscience is so much a matter of climate. A Midlandton
      conscience finds London air very relaxing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>sitting slowly right as before</i>). I don't think you ought to
      disturb your mother, Mr. Garside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>resuming his own chair, with conscious hypocrisy</i>). No. Old
      people need such a lot of sleep. So that's settled. Let me see. I was
      talking about myself, wasn't I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Yes. You seem to find the subject interesting.

    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. No. You can stick to your text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Thanks. But I wasn't talking about myself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>reflectively</i>). I don't remember the exception. It was all
      yourself and the money you're going to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. The money. Yes. I'm making money, Miss Mottram, and I'm going to
      make more. Do you know why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Money's always useful, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes, even a little of it. But I shan't be satisfied with little.
      And I'm a fairly frugal man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. You'll grow into a miser on the margin between your moderate wants
      and your colossal income.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I might grow into a married man on that margin. It's to be a good
      margin, because I believe no man should ask his wife to accept a lower
      standard of living than she's been accustomed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I didn't know Miss Shawcross lived so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>rising, sternly</i>). It isn't a question of Miss Shaweross.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I thought it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. So did I when I was a boy in Midlandton about a hundred years ago.
      I'm wiser now. Women of her class can't adapt themselves to changed
      circumstances. They're a drag on a man's career. You've seen Miss
      Shawcross?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Well, you know the type. Good, plodding, conscientious, provincial
      girl, with about as much ambition as a potato. Marry her to a bank clerk
      and she'll be in her proper place. Picture her the wife of a Cabinet
      Minister, and&mdash;well, no, you can't. It's unthinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. The wife of a what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>imperviously</i>). A Cabinet Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. But you're not a Cabinet Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>quite seriously</i>). No, I'm young yet. What a man of my stamp
      wants is a wife who can help him to push his way, not one I'd be ashamed
      to show in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I see. You're marrying into one of the big political families.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. No. I'm showing you how you can be done with Midlandton and get to
      London. You said you'd do anything for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I meant anything in reason. Shall we change the subject?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>ys (<i>rising, curtly</i>). Then I must go back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Your brother's coming for you. Meantime I ask you to remember the
      difference between the Peter Garside of six months ago and the Garside of
      to-day. I've bridged the gulf that lay between us. A man of genius can do
      things like that. I meant what I said, Miss Mottram. I didn't say it till
      you encouraged me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I have not encouraged you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You're here, you know. You let your brother go without you. You let
      my mother leave us alone. Isn't that encouragement?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. (<i>as cruelly as she can</i>). I stayed because I find you amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. I dare say I am amusing. People in deadly earnest usually are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>gently</i>). We'll forget what you said, Mr. Garside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. No, we won't. I can't ask you to marry me yet because I am not
      rich. I'm merely prospering. But I ask you to wait. Give me a year&mdash;no,
      six months. I can offer you a home in London then. It won't be worthy of
      you, but we shan't stagnate. May I come to you in six months' time to get
      your answer to the question I haven't yet the right to ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. No. Rut I know six months of Midlandton are longer than six years
      here. You badly want to live in London now. You'll want it worse then.
      Don't think of me as I was. That's buried. Think of me as I am and as I'm
      going to be. (<i>Electric bell rings right.</i>) That's probably your
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b> (<i>half sorry, but on the whole relieved</i>). Yes. Don't keep him
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>moving right, and stopping</i>). Before I open the door won't
      you tell me what I want to know? It's all for you&mdash;all my ambitions.
      I only want position for you to grace it, money for you to spend. Give me
      six happy months of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>with a low laugh</i>). Will hoping make you happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes, if you tell me I may hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b> (<i>sincerely</i>). Then by all means hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Bell rings again.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. That's all I want. (<i>He looks at her humbly. She extends her hand
      impulsively. Peter kisses it reverently.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. You're very absurd. Now let my brother in.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Peter crosses and opens door right, leaving it half open, as he goes
      through and opens outside door.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>heard off right, in surprised voice</i>). Hullo!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. (<i>off right, less loudly</i>). Good evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Peter appears outside door right, pulling it to him.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>off</i>). Leave your coats here. Excuse me. I'll&mdash;I'll just
      close this door and keep the cold out till you're ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>He enters rapidly, opening the door as little as possible, and closing
      it quickly, putting his back to it. The manouvre is not, however, executed
      fast enough to prevent Jones peering over his shoulder as he enters.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>standing against the door</i>). It's not your brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>dryly</i>). I gathered that. I'd better go without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>agitated</i>). You can't. That's the only way out. They'd see
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>surprised</i>). I don't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. They mustn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>. Why not? Who are they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Constituents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>alarmed</i>). From Midlandton?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. Let them get a glimpse of you, and God only knows what tale
      will be over Midlandton.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Glad</b>, (<i>agreeing</i>). Yes. They mus'n't see me. On no account. (<i>She
      crosses to left, Peter nods approvingly.</i>) Peter. My mother's there.
      I'll get rid of them quickly. Glad. Remember, I'm trusting you.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Exit Gladys, left. Peter opens door right, and speaks off.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Ready, comrades? Come in. (<i>Ned and Jones enter, dressed much as
      in Act I. Peter is genial.</i>) How are you? Both well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>as they shake hands</i>). Yes, thanks. (<i>With slight emphasis.</i>)
      Are you well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Quite well, thanks. Never better in my life. (<i>Ned and Jones
      exchange glances.</i>) Sit down, comrades. It's good to see Midlandton
      faces again.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Ned in arm-chair right, Jones left, Peter in revolving chair. Peter's
      attitude at first is the mixture of obsequiousness and patronage of an
      M.P. to influential supporters.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. I suppose you don't see many people from the old town here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You're the first I've seen since I came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. And what brings you to town? Pleasure, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Well&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes, I know. London's a playground to you fellows. It's more like a
      battlefield to your hard-worked member.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>firmly</i>). It's not exactly pleasure we're here for, Comrade
      Garside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. More like business. We're a sort of a delegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Delegates, eh? What's on? I don't remember any congress at the
      moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. We're on a special mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>obviously forcing an appearance of interest</i>). Now, that's
      very interesting. May I ask the object of this mission?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>grimly</i>). You're the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. Yes. We've a crow to pluck with you, my lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>not yet greatly concerned</i>). Oh? Something you want to
      discuss?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Something we're going to discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>rising</i>). Well, suppose I meet you to-morrow morning. Come
      here at&mdash;yes&mdash;at eleven, and I'll give you an hour with
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>shaking his head</i>). You'll give us an hour, or as long as we
      want, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Really, I'm afraid I can't. (<i>Involuntarily glancing left.</i>)
      I'm busy to-night. I'll see you to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. We shan't be here to-morrow. We've to go back by the midnight
      train. We've our livings to earn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Well, look here, eome back in an hour or so, and I'll see you then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>commandingly</i>). You'll see us now. Your time's ours, we pay
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You haven't bought me, you know. You pay me to represent your
      interests at Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Then why aren't you there representing them to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>irritably</i>). I've told you I'm busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Busy with what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Mind your own business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>quietly</i>). It is our business. We've a right to know why you're
      neglecting your duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>hotly</i>). I don't neglect my duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. What's on at the House to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>embarrassed</i>). Well&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>inexorably</i>). What's on?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. The Right to Work Bill, I believe. (<i>Sitting again.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. Yes. The Right to Work Bill. The cornerstone of the Labour policy.
      Any Labour member who's absent from to-night's division deserves drumming
      out of the party as a traitor to its cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, I'll be there for the division if you don't keep me here too
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. The division's over. You're out of your place on the most important
      night of the session. You've missed your ehanee to speak. You've missed
      the division. You've not paired. Your vote's lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. It's not. The division can't take plaee so early.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. We've been to the House. We thought we'd find you there. Why
      weren't you there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I've told you I was busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. You told the Whip on the telephone you were ill&mdash;too ill to turn
      out. We were there when he rang you up. We eome here, and we find you
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I <i>am</i> indisposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Indisposed!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I meant to go. I started out to go only I became ill on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. You told us when you shook hands you'd never been better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, I dare say. The usual figure of speech. I <i>am</i> recovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. No. You spoke the truth then. You're lying now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Lying! This is too much. (<i>Rising.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>rising</i>). You'll like it less before we've finished. We're
      not in London losing a day's wages for our health. We've been called up to
      decide what's to be done with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>angrily</i>). You'll decide what's to be done with me. You!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>firmly</i>). We have decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>still sitting</i>). They've been showing us your record at the
      Whip's office. You ignore them. You go to the House when you think you
      will. You refuse to submit to discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I serve the cause in my own way. (<i>He is consciously on his
      defence now.</i>) It's a better way than listening to dry-as-dust debates
      and tramping endless miles through the division lobbies. I'm getting at
      the people. I'm carrying the fiery sword of revolutionary Socialism
      through the length and breadth of the land. I'm the harbinger of the new
      age. Wherever I go I leave behind me an awakened people, stirred from
      their lethargy and indolent acceptance of things as they are, fired with
      new hopes of the coming dispensation, eager to throw off the yoke and
      strike their blow for freedom, justice, and the social revolution. That's
      my work, comrades, not wasting my energy, my gift of oratory on the
      canting hypocrites at Westminster, but keeping them fresh for the honest
      man outside. I'm going to quarter England, town by town, until&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>rising, and putting his hand on Peter's arm, shaking his head</i>).
      It won't do, Garsidc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. You needn't wag that silver tongue at us. You're found out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Found out! You can't find out a man you're incapable of
      understanding. You can't drive genius with a bearing rein. I'm a man of
      genius, and you're angry because I can't be a cog in the parliamentary
      machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>quietly</i>). Whatever you are, you're paid to be a cog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. If I'm to do my great work for the cause I must live somehow. The
      labourer is worthy of his hire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. You're hired twice over. You get lecture fees when you ought to be
      in the House. You make local secretaries compete for your lectures to
      force your price up. You've got swelled head till you think you can do as
      you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I won't be dictated to by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. And yet we're your masters, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. It's my nature to be a free lance. Routine would kill me. I've to
      work for the cause in my own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. We don't want free lances. We want workers. If you want to speak to
      the people aren't your week-ends and vacations good enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. A hundred days to every week are not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. We sent you to Parliament to obey the Party Whips and be governed by
      older and wiser heads than yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Nelson won battles by disobeying orders. If you didn't want
      independence you shouldn't have chosen me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. We see that now. You'd ceased to be representative of the
      Midlandton working classes before we chose you for our candidate. You <i>were</i>
      a B.A. You're still less able to represent us now when you make as much in
      a month as your average constituent does in a year. We'll have a better
      man next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. You find an ignorant, dense average specimen of the British
      workman without a soul above thirty shillings a week, and he'll just about
      represent the ideas and ambitions of the Midlandton mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Yes, he'll represent us better than you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Then God help representative government! You'd better be careful.
      My personal popularity's your finest platform asset.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. Well, it's an asset we can do without. Put it that you're too
      brilliant for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, it's the old story. Genius and the Philistine. For two pins I'd
      resign my seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b> (<i>gravely</i>). We accept your resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. We come here to demand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>abject</i>). Comrades, you don't mean this! You wouldn't do a
      man out of his job.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>curtly</i>). Oh, we're finding you a new job.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. The Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>slight pause</i>). I won't resign. You've tried and judged me in
      my absence. You haven't given me a chance to say a word in my own defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ned</b>. You can talk till you're blue in the face without shifting facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>growing increasingly hysterical</i>). The facts are that I'm a
      Member of the House of Commons for the term of this Parliament, and you
      can't force me to resign until I do it of my own free will. I'm still M.P.
      for Midlandton, if I've to sleep on the Embankment. I'll go to the House
      in rags. I'll be an M.P. still, M.P. for the outcast, the despised, the
      rejected, the human derelicts, victims of jealousy and injustice and all
      man's inhumanity to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b> (<i>contemptuously</i>). You're the victim of nothing but your own
      swelled head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'm the victim of my own great nature. A nature that's cast in too
      large a mould to submit to pettifogging little rules. My life was the
      people's. I demanded nothing in return but a free hand and no
      interference. I've to do this mighty task in my own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Yes. The way you found most profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'm spending every penny I earn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jones</b>. Yes. I'll believe you for once. This place proves that. We sent you
      here to be our representative, not to be a bloody * gentleman. I know what
      your indisposition was that kept you from the House tonight. I saw its
      skirts when you opened the door. That's what we're paying for. For you to&mdash;faugh,
      you sicken me.

      nothing themselves, but they won't give young blood a chance. Mediocrity's
      their motto. They've no use for brains. So I'm kicked out.

    <p>

      hear anything else. It's driving me mad. Up and down, up and down, all day
      long, and all night too, till he drops because he's too tired to put one
      foot before the other. It's like a wild beast in a cage.

      he'll never show his face in Midlandton again. I've done all the work.
      Getting the furniture out of store and everything. Peter didn't raise a
      hand.

    <p>
      <b>Mrs. G</b>. I don't know if I did. It reminds him. Won't take his food now.
      That's the latest. Not that I've much to give him. Heaven knows where
      it'll end. We with no money coming in and nearly every penny as we had
      gone to pay his debts in London and fetch us here. Workhouse next, I
      reckon.

    <p>
      <b>O'Cal</b>. (<i>patting her shoulder encouragingly</i>). Let you not be talking
      like that, Mrs. Garside. There's no call to despair. Peter's got to be
      roused.

      <b>Mrs. G</b>. (<i>rising, with more force in her voice</i>). Denis O'Callagan,
      if you've a plan to rouse my poor boy I've told you to go upstairs and try
      it on him. If you've come to stand there like a log and tell me what I've
      known this week and more, there's my door, and the sooner you put your
      ugly face outside it the better you'll please me.

      you could lay your tongue to when I came in last week.

      <b>Peter</b> (<i>turning</i>). That's my tragedy. Waste. At twenty-six I'm
      looking backward on a closed account. The future's blank&mdash;all the
      brilliant fruitful years I might have lived.

    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>sitting left of table, elbows on table and head in hands</i>).
      Oh, what's the use of that? I'm finished. Out, middle stump. And there's
      no second innings in life.

    <p>

      I've shot my bolt. I'm a man with a past, an ex-M.P., ex-Everything.

      <b>Peter</b>. Demonstration?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. We're all tremendously impressed. You've thoroughly alarmed us.
      That's what you wanted, wasn't it? (<i>Peter meets her eye questioningly.</i>)
      To prove to yourself that after all you're still of consequence to
      somebody. It's quite true, Peter. We're not content to watch you sulk to

      arrogance of youth.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. How did you mean to act?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I meant to ask forgiveness on my knees for all the things I said to
      you. Up in my room I'd come to see it all, sec what a swine I'd been, how
      right you were, how much you knew me better than I knew myself. I thought
      in London that I'd met the worst. I thought my bitterest hour was past.
      But worst and bitterest of all was when I realised all that I'd done to
      you, all that that doing made me miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>hardly</i>). Then when I came you didn't do as you intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Margaret, I saw you and I felt ashamed. It's one thing to decide
      within one's mind to do a thing, but quite another thing to do it in the
      flesh. I saw you, saw the suffering in your face and knew that I had
      caused it all. I felt ashamed to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Ashamed to ask forgiveness? Ashamed to carry out your plan?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. We weren't alone. There were others there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Just pride, in fact. You were too proud to ask. And when the others
      went?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Oh, yes. Yes. Pride again. Then, too, until&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Till when? You've not asked yet.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Peter, when your mother let me come, I came.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. So I thought it worth while.

    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Margaret, you are so beautiful, and I&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Listen to me, Peter. You tell me I am beautiful. You told me I am
      young. I am, but I'm a year older than I was twelve months ago. Twelve
      months ago, when you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. It's been a crowded year for you. (<i>Gesture from Peter.</i>) Too
      crowded, yes, but there was glamour in it all. You've paid a price, but
      you've known the flavour of success. You've had your fun. I've spent my
      year in Midlandton&mdash;(<i>Peter shudders</i>)&mdash;a plaee where one
      can live, Peter. Oh, yes, one can. But I've been lonely here. A year's
      dropped from me sadly, slowly. I've kept myself alive and that, the daily
      round, is all my history, while you&mdash;well, never mind. The past is
      past. We're where we were a year ago, a little older, just a little less
      in love with life, but still we're here, Peter. You and I, just as we were
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Just as we were?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Why not? Love understands. We're both a little scarred. We both need
      picking up and making whole. We need each other, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You need me! Margaret, you're not just putting it that way because&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. So you will have me, Peter?

    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I think I always loved you, Margaret. Throughout the madness of my
      pride, behind it all, I think I never quite forgot the great reality of
      you. I've been ambition's drunkard, but behind the mist of self-deluded
      dream, the light shone dimly though. London brought me no peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. I'll bring you peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I think you will. (<i>From her.</i>) Oh, but it's madness, madness,
      Margaret. What are we thinking of?

    <p>

      <b>Mar</b>. (<i>quickly</i>). No phrases, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'm a man without a job, Margaret. I can't keep myself, let alone
      anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Have you tried?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I've thought of ways. Scraps of journalism, perhaps. I might live
      that way for a time. I'm a notorious person. They'll take my stuff until&mdash;my&mdash;my
      escapade's forgotten. Then they'll drop me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Excellent reasons for not being a journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'm fit for nothing else. I thought I had supporters, friends who'd
      rally round when the official party sent me to the rightabout. I've waited
      there a week. I have no friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. You don't need friends. You want an employer, and I thought you were
      a skilled mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes. As a matter of fact I did have a vague idea of going in for
      aeroplanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Oh, Peter, Peter, still the high flights!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b> (<i>earnestly</i>). There's money in it, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. For the mechanic?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I shouldn't be a mechanic long. A man of original mind like me is
      bound to be ahead of the crowd. I've to keep moving fast. I can't wait for
      the mob to catch me up. Yes, there's something in that aeroplane idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. There is. Fame. Applause. Incense. Everything that ruined you before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You can't be famous without risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Why be famous?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. That's your doing. You wakened my ambitions. They're there now,
      ineradically fixed, and if they weren't there for myself, they would be
      there for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. For me? I don't want them, Peter. Fight them down. Be humble.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I'm not built for humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Drop your ambition, Peter. You will feel like Christian when he lost
      his pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. What do you want me to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. There is always room for you at your old place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Back to the mechanic's bench. In Midlandton, where everybody knows!
      That's humble pie with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. A new beginning, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. There's no such thing. In life, we pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. We'll pay together then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. I can't go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. A man can do things for his woman, Peter, when he can't do them for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. You want me to go back?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Yes, Peter, back to the starting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. It's a bitter pill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. But won't you swallow it&mdash;for me? For my sake, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes, Margaret, you've won. I'll go back if they'll have me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Thank you, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Don't thank me, dear. It's&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Why not? It means I'm going to have my heart's desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Just you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Margaret!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Yes, Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Are you happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. Yes? Only yes? When I'm almost afraid to be so happy, when&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Yes, Peter, when you are down, you are very, very down, and when
      you're up you are up&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Peter</b>. That's the way with all geniuses. Oh, I forgot. I'm not a&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Never mind. You're genius enough for me. Only, we'll stop telling
      other people about it, eh, Peter? Now let's go to your mother.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
